+ The learning stuff is gonna start with the one of the most and required application

+ This is the only way to create the Login application.

+ The purpose of this application is creating an app with Login/Logout functionality.

+ The application is created using the classic toolkit in ExtJS 6.

+ As the focus is specifically on the Classic toolkit, so avoided using the Modern or Universal toolkit (providing both the Classic and Modern toolkit).

+ The app is ment to design an implementation containing 'Logged in' and 'Logged out' view.

+ This application does not attempt to achieve secure data connection, session management, true authentication, etc.


			-- ** GENERATING THE APPLICATION ** --
sencha -skd {path/to/ExtJS_6.2.0_SDK} generate app -classic {application_name} {absolute or relative path of the application}

     << Just replace '-classic' by '-modern' for building app using Modern toolkit >>
     << Specify neither '-classic' nor '-modern' for building app using Universal toolkit >>



			-- ** RUNNING THE APPLICATION ** --
The application can be executed using the console command 'sencha app watch' in the root directory of the application.

Checkout the socket address of the application from the console and navigate to it in the browser to see the application running.
